### Added

#### ðŸš€ Core QUIC Support
- **Client endpoints**: Create QUIC client connections with `createClientEndpoint()`
- **Server endpoints**: Create QUIC server connections with `createServerEndpoint()`
- **TLS configuration**: Full support for TLS 1.3 with `serverConfigWithSingleCert()`
- **Stream operations**: Bidirectional and unidirectional streams for data transfer
- **Connection management**: Connection stats, RTT monitoring, and remote address info
- **Datagram support**: Unreliable message delivery for real-time applications

#### ðŸŽ¯ Convenience API
- **HTTP-style interface**: Familiar GET/POST methods with QUIC performance
- **Connection pooling**: Automatic connection reuse and management
- **Retry logic**: Built-in exponential backoff for failed requests
- **Timeout protection**: Configurable timeouts for all operations
- **Configuration management**: Fine-grained control over connection parameters

#### ðŸ”§ Developer Experience
- **Async/await support**: Full Flutter integration with Future-based APIs
- **Memory safety**: Rust ownership prevents memory leaks and corruption
- **Type safety**: Generated bindings with compile-time guarantees
- **Error handling**: Specific error types for different failure scenarios
- **Cross-platform**: Support for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS, and Linux

#### ðŸ“Š Production Features
- **Certificate loading**: Support for PEM/DER certificates and private keys
- **Connection migration**: Seamless WiFi â†” cellular network switching
- **0-RTT connections**: Instant reconnection for repeat connections
- **Stream multiplexing**: Multiple independent streams over single connection
- **Flow control**: Built-in congestion control and bandwidth management

### Technical Details

#### API Coverage
- âœ… **Core API**: Complete 1:1 Quinn library mapping
- âœ… **Convenience API**: HTTP-style wrapper for common use cases
- âœ… **Client operations**: Full client-side QUIC functionality
- âœ… **Server operations**: Complete server-side QUIC implementation
- âœ… **Certificate management**: TLS certificate loading and validation

#### Performance Features
- **Head-of-line blocking elimination**: Independent stream processing
- **Reduced connection overhead**: Single connection replaces multiple TCP connections
- **Built-in security**: TLS 1.3 integration without additional handshake overhead
- **Network adaptation**: Dynamic adjustment to changing network conditions

#### Platform Support

- **Mobile-optimized**: Battery-aware optimizations for mobile platforms

### Known Limitations
- **Web platform**: Not supported (WebTransport may be added in future)
- **HTTP/3 semantics**: Raw QUIC transport only (HTTP/3 helpers planned)
- **Advanced TLS**: Custom certificate validation not yet implemented

### Dependencies
- `quinn = "0.11"` - Core QUIC implementation
- `flutter_rust_bridge = "2.11.1"` - Rust-Flutter integration
- `tokio` - Async runtime for Rust operations
- `rustls` - TLS 1.3 implementation

### Breaking Changes
- None (initial release)
